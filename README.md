# ProjetGNS


dev : unused techs (gns3fy and telnetelib)
improving : development to generate intent files from various configs and from simpler initial intent (with less info)
refconfig : config files from a working bgp ospf & rip network


V3 version
works only on the network given for the project : uses bgp, ospf and rip and configures it depending on the intent file : intent.json

HOW TO RUN : change the variable local_path to the path of your path to the routers of your networks in the main.py file
then run main.py
